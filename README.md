# ACM-ICPC-analysis
The code scrapes icpc.global for ACM ICPC results and analyses them. You can use the code by running the command:
```
python3 main region
```
Where region is the ICPC regional you are interested in. For example: northwestern-europe, central-europe or World-Finals are valid arguments.
